This repository contains a PowerShell script which creates a backup of the `%APPDATA%/Thunderbird` folder.


## Requirements

To use this script, you must be running [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases) on a 64-bit version of windows and you must have [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) installed.

## Usage

[Download](https://www.wikihow.com/Download-a-File-from-GitHub) the [PowerShell script](https://github.com/Valkryst/Backup_Thunderbird/blob/main/backup.ps1) and then run it either by double-clicking the file or by right-clicking and selecting "Run with PowerShell".

It may take some time to run.

When the script completes, you will find `Thunderbird.7z` on your Desktop.
